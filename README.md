Continuous-Time Signals and Systems

In these assignments, I have accomplished the following:

- Utilized MATLAB effectively for signal and system modeling and problem-solving.
- Applied basic properties of convolution to analyze continuous-time signals and Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems.
- Used fundamental properties of Fourier and Laplace transforms to analyze the input-output relationship of systems.
- Established connections between frequency-domain representations of signals and systems and their characteristics in the time domain.
- Demonstrated understanding of the relationships among various representations of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems.
